This project simplifies the user expereince of gathering data from mulitple sources. With using WeatherQuest, the user can find news, temperature, weather description, country, state of where they clicked.

When first arriving at the website, you will be met with a map of the earth. The user able to scroll and zoom to the desired location. After a location is clicked, below the map, news, temperature, weather description, country, state of where they clicked will be displayed. The user is able to click next and previous to look through the news articles and if they wish to learn more about the article they can click the 'Read More' button. If the user wishes to see another location, they can simply return to the map and click the new desired location.

Nothing is required of the user to download if they wish to utlize this website.

Step One: Our Project Idea
Development research began with researching into APIs that could help us achieve viewing a location and weather information based on the location.
We found both the GeoLocation API, OpenWeather and newsdata.io API to start the beginning development process.
Step Two: Development of our Web Application
As we progressed into developing the application, we created a repository on GitHub for collaboration purposes followed by the implementation of the GeoLocation API  and OpenWeather to help with navigability and weather forecasting. The news article API was switched out during this process to webz.io as it allowed us to handle multiple search terms (i.e., weather United States Michigan).
Step Three: Designing the Front End
After finishing the development of the back end, we stylized the front end using a light color scheme to make it look more professional to the user while also stylizing the text and font color.
